-Instructions for time display in seconds and millisecons on VLC or MPV. 
Personally, I recommend MPV because you need less interactions to get the timestamps.

[==For MPV users==]:
(1). Go to /home/YourUser/.config/mpv   [The folder ".config" is hidden, press CTRL+H to see hidden files]
(2). If the folder "mpv" doesnt exist create one
(3). Once inside "mpv" folder, create a file called "input.conf"
(4). Edit the file with any text editor and copy paste this:


S show-text "${=time-pos}"   # Show time on pressing the key assigend
A frame-step                 # advance one frame and pause
D frame-back-step            # go back by one frame and pause  


(5). You can change that keybinding to your personal preference. But by default pressing "S" will show you the time. Use "A" and "D" to move frame by frame.
(6). Done!





[==For VLC users==]:
(1). Download the plugin "Jump to Time (Previous Frame)v3" Link --->  https://addons.videolan.org/p/1154013/ 

(2). Copy the .lua file to the extensions folder. According to offical page, extension can be in one of these folders:
       /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/vlc/lua/extensions/      <---(here worked for me)
       /usr/lib/vlc/lua/extensions/
       ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/

(3). Restart vlc or press reload extensions button.
(4). Open the extension from menu or with right click on the video.
(5). Set the time format to seconds only.
(6). Navigate trough video. Press "E" for fowarding frame by frame and copy the exact timestamps to VTOG interface. 
(7). Done!
